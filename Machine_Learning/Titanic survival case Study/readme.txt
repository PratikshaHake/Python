Titanic survival case study

This application is based on supervised machine learning
There is one dataset which contains information about all passangers from titanic such as its name,age,seat number ticket price,floor etc.
First clean the data set by removing unnecessary entries and columns.
 I applied logistic regression technique to train the dataset and predict whether the passenger can survive or not depends on its data entries.
