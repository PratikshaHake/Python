Iris Case Study
1.This application based on supervised machine learning
2.There is one dataset which contains the information about iris flowers like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width etc.
3.I used multiple classification algorithm to train the data set and predict whether the iris flower is centosa,versicolor or virginica. 



Iris Classification case study is solved using multiple classification algorithms as:
1.DecisionTreeClassifier -iris1.py
2.K Nearest NEighbour -KNN1.py
2.Support vector machine -irisSVM2.py
